# currency-transaction-easy-consumer

This is a simple Spring based currency transaction consumer which matches the 'easy' case on the code test.
It takes a selection of sample data from the producer, outputs it to the console and writes it to a file.

This is not robust or production code and is a 'quick and dirty' solution to this problem written in about 35 minutes.
